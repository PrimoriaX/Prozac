## üöÄ Getting Started

### Preparing Your Arduino

1. **Install Python:** Download [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-amd64.exe), the most compatible version for Prozac.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command line.
3. **Configure Arduino:** Execute `prozacsetup.py` to configure your Arduino board. Follow the instructions carefully.
4. **Launch Prozac:** After setup, you're good to go with `main.py`.

A detailed [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/pPDarnIaIG4) is available for a step-by-step guide.

### Personalizing Prozac
1. Configuration: Adjust settings in [prozac.py](https://github.com/xPrimoria/Prozac/blob/main/prozac.py#L11-L22). The file contains easy-to-modify configuration options.
2. Experiment: Find your optimal settings through trial and error. Remember, there‚Äôs no universally "best setting."
3. Modify Source Code: To ensure ongoing effectiveness, modify the source code before use. Tips for modifications are shared in our [Discord server](discord.gg/bsNKqvxvE2).
