<h1 align="center">Prozac üíä</h1>

Prozac is a sophisticated, color-based aiming assistance bot, created for **educational purposes**.

## üõ† Setup Requirements

Before diving into Prozac, you'll need **only one** of these Arduino boards:

- [Arduino Leonardo](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-leonardo-with-headers?selectedStore=us) `(Recommened)`
- [Arduino Micro](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-micro?selectedStore=us)

For an exclusive, enhanced version of Prozac, join our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bsNKqvxvE2).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Preparing Your Arduino

1. **Install Python:** Download [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-amd64.exe), the most compatible version for Prozac.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command line.
3. **Configure Arduino:** Execute `prozacsetup.py` to configure your Arduino board. Follow the instructions carefully.
4. **Launch Prozac:** After setup, you're good to go with `main.py`.

A detailed [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/pPDarnIaIG4) is available for a step-by-step guide.

### Personalizing Prozac
1. **Configuration:** Adjust settings in [prozac.py](https://github.com/PrimoriaX/Prozac/blob/main/prozac.py#L10-L29). The file contains easy-to-modify configuration options.
2. **Experiment:** Find your optimal settings through trial and error. Remember, there‚Äôs no universally "best setting."
3. **Modify Source Code:** To ensure ongoing effectiveness, modify the source code before use. Tips for modifications are shared in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bsNKqvxvE2).

## üéì Educational Purpose
Our primary goal with Prozac is to provide a hands-on learning experience for students and enthusiasts in programming and hardware interfacing. This project is an excellent resource for understanding how software can interact with hardware (like Arduino boards) to perform real-time tasks. It's also a great starting point for those interested in exploring computer vision and color detection in Python.
